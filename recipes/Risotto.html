    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A friend of mine, an experienced mushroom forager, gave me a jar of her 
        porcini mushroom powder. It's like brown gold! I added it to my usual mushroom risotto 
        and I must say, it's the best mushroom risotto I've ever made.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon porcini mushroom powder</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cups low-fat chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring chicken broth to a simmer in a large saucepan over
             medium heat. Whisk in mushroom powder. Cover, lower heat,
              and keep at a simmer until needed for risotto.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in another large 
            saucepan over medium-low heat. Add shallot and cook, 
            stirring often, until soft but not browned, 3 to 5 minutes. 
            Add rice and bay leaf and stir until evenly coated. Increase 
            heat to medium and cook until rice releases a nutty smell and
             looks glassy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add wine and 1/4 cup of simmering 
             broth. Cook, stirring constantly, until all liquid has been 
             absorbed.</li>
    </ol>
